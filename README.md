PhotonOS Build: 03-10-2018

**Fixes Sudo issue**

++Adds Cloud-init

Includes a number of stress and networking utils and Openstack client Tools
(machine-id emptied so upon deploy / boot it can properly receive a DHCP address)

sysbench
stress
iperf3
iptraf
iotop
tcptraceroute
mtr
sysstats
dstat
htop
hping
dtrace


full openstack client as well as all openstack projects (nova, neutron, cinder, glance etc etc..) all major cli client tools
for all projects in Openstack Queens

and i'm sure a lot of other quirkly performance / admin tools that i've installed but forgot to add to the list.
